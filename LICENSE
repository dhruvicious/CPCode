Welcome, fellow code gladiator, to this disaster of a repository, where logic goes to die
and test cases fear to tread. By daring to open this file—or accidentally clicking it
while scrolling—you have automatically agreed, whether you knew it or not, to a series
of legally meaningless but emotionally devastating terms and warnings below.

Permissions (for the brave, the foolish, and the caffeine-addicted):
---------------------------------------------------
1. Use: Run it, compile it, debug it, cry over it, or stare at it wondering why your last 
   submission got WA on test case #7. No guarantees, no miracles.  
2. Copy: Make as many clones as your GitHub storage allows. All copies inherit the same 
   mysterious runtime errors.  
3. Modify: Hack it, patch it, optimize it, or add comments that future-you will deeply regret.  
4. Merge: Combine it with other code if you enjoy existential crises and midnight panic.  
5. Publish: Brag about it to the world, knowing deep down that at least 42% of the code 
   is probably unnecessary or outright wrong.  
6. Submit to CP contests: Absolutely. Good luck getting AC. Seriously. You’ll need it.  

Conditions:
---------------------------------------------------
- Keep this copyright notice intact.  
- Any reference to sanity, dignity, or proper indentation must remain in all copies.  
- Attempting to remove humor from this code may result in mysterious TLEs on every problem.  

Disclaimer:
---------------------------------------------------
This Software is provided "AS IS," meaning:
- It may compile. It may crash. It may output 42 for no reason.  
- It may pass the sample cases and then fail every hidden test case spectacularly.  
- It may cause you to question your life choices, your college major, and your relationship
  with competitive programming itself.  
- The author bears no responsibility for rage-quitting, keyboard abuse, or existential despair.  

Liability:
---------------------------------------------------
In no event shall the authors, contributors, or any caffeine-fueled night owl within
50 km of this code be held liable for:
- Wrong answers, wrong logic, or wrong submissions
- Keyboard smashing or monitor abuse
- Sudden urges to uninstall C++/Rust/Java/Python
- Any existential crises caused by the harsh truths of test cases  

Acknowledgments:
---------------------------------------------------
By using this Software, you also acknowledge:
- You probably thought you were better at CP than you actually are.  
- Future-you will curse past-you for writing it.  
- The universe may punish you with WA, TLE, or RE at the worst possible moment.  
- Laughter, tears, and mild insanity are guaranteed, sometimes simultaneously.
