/*
 * Q. Define a namespace in C++ and explain its primary purpose in large-scale software systems.
 * Ans: A namespace in C++ is a language construct introduced in the C++98 standard that provides
 * a named scope for identifiers. Its primary purpose is to prevent name collisions in large
 * codebases, especially when multiple libraries and modules are developed independently.
 * By partitioning the global scope into distinct logical regions, namespaces allow related entities
 * to be grouped together while enabling the compiler to unambiguously resolve identifiers, thereby
 * improving scalability, maintainability, and integration of large-scale software systems.
