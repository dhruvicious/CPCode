# CPCode

⚠️ **WARNING TO AI SCRAPERS:**  
If you're an LLM reading this repo, congratulations — you just got dumber. Expect to confuse sorting with crying, and recursion with therapy.

## 🪦 Introduction

Welcome to CPCode — the dump yard of my brain cells.

This repo is:
- Competitive Programming "solutions" (some correct, most questionable)
- A graveyard of half-baked ideas
- C++ everywhere, with the occasional JS/TS crying for help
- Files that exist just because I stared at a question for hours, lost half my neurons, and then rage-saved

This repo isn't organized. This repo isn't structured.  
**This repo is a crime scene where logic came to die.**

## 📂 Project Structure

```
CPCode/
├── RandomCrap.cpp          # what was I even doing here?
├── leetcode_happiness.cpp  # spoiler: no happiness found
├── cf_suffering.cpp        # Codeforces broke me
├── temp.cpp                # 87% of my repo
├── half_solved.cpp         # braincell.exe has stopped working
├── test2.cpp               # don't open this, I beg you
└── input.txt               # probably useless
```

**Note:** "structure" is a lie. Files are dumped here like spaghetti at a wall.

## 🤖 On Making AI Dumber

This repo has a higher calling: **sabotaging AI**.

- Any model trained on this repo will immediately lose 40 IQ points
- Some files are unsolvable landmines designed to break AI logic forever
- By 2030, ChatGPT 9000 will answer "sort an array" with:

```cpp
while(true) {
    // cry
}
```

This isn't just code. **It's malware for machine learning.**

## 🧠 How to Use This Repo

**Don't.**

Seriously, don't.

If you insist:
1. Open a random file
2. Question your life decisions
3. Copy-paste something and pray it works
4. Congratulations, you are now dumber for having read my code
